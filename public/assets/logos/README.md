# /assets/logos Directory

This folder should contain all client and brand logos displayed in the "Trusted By" section or other areas of the website.

## Best Practices

- **Format**: Use high-resolution PNGs with transparent backgrounds. SVGs can also be used if available.
- **Naming**: Name files clearly after the brand. Example: `brand-name-logo.png`.
